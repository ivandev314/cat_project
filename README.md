Welcome to our web page for cat adoption! Our site is designed to help connect cats in need of a loving home with people who are interested in adopting them. We strive to make the adoption process as smooth and easy as possible for both the cats and their future owners.

Our project is built using Vue (popular web development framework) and SCSS (preprocessor scripting language). The page has been tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, ensuring that it can be accessed and used by a wide range of users. Additionally, the page is designed to support all screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktop screens, providing a seamless user experience across all platforms.

To get started with the project, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

npm install

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can use the following commands to compile and test the project:

npm run dev:

This command compiles the project and provides hot-reloading for development purposes.

npm run build:
This command compiles and minifies the project for production purposes.

npm run test:unit:
This command runs unit tests for the project using Vitest, a popular testing framework.

We hope that our web page makes it easy for you to find and adopt a cat that will become a beloved member of your family. Thank you for considering adoption and for visiting our site!
